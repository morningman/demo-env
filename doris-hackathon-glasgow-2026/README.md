## How to submit

Submissions are open until **31 October 2026**. There is no form to fill in: a pull request is your submission.

1. Create a folder named after **your GitHub ID** in this directory: `doris-hackathon-glasgow-2026/<your-github-id>/`.
2. Put your work in it:
   - your code;
   - a `README.md` that says which task you did (A1–A4), what your project does, how to run it, and which Doris features it uses, with one screenshot or GIF.
3. Open a pull request against `main`. Either fork the repository and push, or stay in the browser: open this folder, choose **Add file → Create new file**, type `<your-github-id>/README.md` as the file name (the slash creates your folder), then add the other files with **Add file → Upload files**. GitHub forks the repository for you and opens the pull request.

What your README should also answer, per task:

| Task | Also include |
| --- | --- |
| A1 Hybrid Search App | How keyword, vector and hybrid results differ for one or two queries you tried |
| A2 Ask Doris with MCP | Your MCP client, your config without secrets, the questions you asked, the SQL that ran, and the refused write |
| A3 Log Search Explorer | The root-cause service, the minute it started, and the query that proves it |
| A4 Agent Trace Explorer | Three insights from the data, including your verdict on the v2 release |

Please keep the pull request small: no secrets or API keys, no `node_modules` or virtual environments, and no copies of the starter-kit seed files.

Working in a team is fine, but not needed: submit one folder, named after one member, and list every member's GitHub ID in its README.

Example:

```text
doris-hackathon-glasgow-2026/
└── octocat/
    ├── README.md
    ├── screenshot.png
    └── search.py
```
